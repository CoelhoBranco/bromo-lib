# bromo-lib
This is the Bromo library repository for python. It is intended to make interaction with the browser easier and more fluid using selenium loading strategies.



# Modo de uso:
As the library is not officially released, one way to use it is to download it and leave it on the same page as the code.

From bromo import Bromo

driver = webdriver.Chrome()

br(driver)

example:

br.click(xpath)
